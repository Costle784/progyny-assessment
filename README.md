# how to run it
- sudo make init to build the docker file
- python app.py to run the script
- output added to logs and std output

# A technical walkthrough of the code and how it works

- used crontab for scheduling hourly run of script

# design decisions
- stuck with poetry as package manager because it was set up
- didn't use any new package, wasn't required
- mysql used

# what can be improved - code and business logic
